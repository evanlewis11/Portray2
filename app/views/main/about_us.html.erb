	<h2>About Portray Advertising</h2>
	
	<p class="text">As the world continues to advance, advertiserâ€™s jobs have become increasingly more difficult.   Viewers are now capable of skipping over 		commercials, newspapers are no longer the go-to source for information and ad-free radio subscriptions are on the rise.  This is not to say that traditional advertising cannot be successful, but a progressive approach must be taken. With 90% of Canadians visiting the mall at least once a month and 62% of all mall visitors eating at a food court, Portray Advertising has created a sophisticated food tray that allows businesses to insert advertisements and engage with daily shoppers.</p>
